# Test-a-Preciptional-Phenomena-Project
In this project, I investigated a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect. 
I created a hypothesis regarding the experiment.
I looked at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and computed some statistics describing the results. 
Finally,I interpreted the results in terms of my hypotheses using the Jupiter Notebook.
